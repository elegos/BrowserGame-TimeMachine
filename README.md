This library aims to help browser game developers to have a set of time-based algorithms ready to be used in their projects.

It includes a `GiacomoFurlan\TimeMachine\Interfaces\TimeMachineInterface` interface and a standard implementation of it (`GiacomoFurlan\TimeMachine\Services\TimeMachine`), including the interfaces needed to let your classes work with the service.

PSR-4 compliant (`src/` => `GiacomoFurlan\TimeMachine\`)
